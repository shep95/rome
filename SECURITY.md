# Security Notice

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: This application implements military-grade encryption and security measures. Proper configuration is essential for maintaining security integrity.

## Security Architecture

This project uses:
- **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)** - All messages encrypted with AES-256-GCM
- **Row Level Security (RLS)** - Database-level access control
- **Device Fingerprinting** - Suspicious activity detection
- **Security Audit Logging** - Comprehensive monitoring
- **Rate Limiting** - Protection against brute force attacks
- **Password Security** - Breach detection and strength validation

## Environment Variables

### ⚠️ NEVER COMMIT .env FILES TO VERSION CONTROL

The `.env` file contains sensitive credentials and MUST be excluded from git.

### Required Configuration

Before deployment, configure these environment variables in your hosting platform:

```bash
# Supabase Configuration
VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id-here
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your-anon-key-here
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
```

### Development Setup

For local development:
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (if example exists)
2. Configure your development credentials
3. **NEVER** commit the `.env` file
4. Use secure, development-specific values (not production credentials)

### Supabase Secrets

Sensitive backend secrets are stored in Supabase Edge Function secrets:
- `APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` - Application encryption master key
- `EMAIL_PEPPER` - Email hashing salt
- `PASSWORD_PEPPER` - Password hashing salt
- Additional service-specific secrets

Access these via: [Supabase Dashboard > Settings > Edge Functions](https://supabase.com/dashboard)

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **TypeScript Strict Mode** - Always enabled to catch type vulnerabilities
2. **Input Validation** - All user inputs validated client and server-side
3. **Dependency Updates** - Regular `npm audit` and security patches
4. **Secure Coding** - Follow guidelines in `SECURE_CODING_PRACTICES.md`
5. **Code Reviews** - Security checklist for all PRs

### For Deployment

1. **Environment Isolation** - Separate dev/staging/production environments
2. **Secret Rotation** - Rotate credentials quarterly
3. **HTTPS Only** - Enforce TLS 1.3+ for all connections
4. **CORS Configuration** - Restrict origins in production
5. **Security Headers** - CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options configured

## Security Audits

### Regular Checks

Run these commands regularly:

```bash
# Check for dependency vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Fix automatically fixable issues
npm audit fix

# Run security linting
npm run lint
```

### Audit Schedule

- **Weekly**: `npm audit` during active development
- **Monthly**: Dependency updates and patch reviews
- **Quarterly**: Comprehensive security audit with Snyk/Dependabot
- **Annually**: Professional penetration testing

## Vulnerability Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue
2. **DO NOT** disclose publicly before it's patched
3. **Email security team** immediately (configure your security contact)
4. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

Response time: Within 48 hours for critical issues

## Incident Response

In case of a security breach:

1. **Immediate**: Isolate affected systems
2. **1 hour**: Notify security team and stakeholders
3. **24 hours**: Assess impact and contain breach
4. **72 hours**: Notify affected users (if data exposed)
5. **1 week**: Post-mortem and security improvements

## Compliance

This project maintains security standards in accordance with:
- OWASP Top 10 Security Risks
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- GDPR principles for data protection
- Industry best practices for E2EE messaging
